## About üçÖ Pomosh


Is it the first time remote working? Or are you tired of distraction at home in these COVID-19 days? Pomosh can help you fight against procrastination and distraction.

### How to:

A working block and a break count as a cycle. A Cycle with a 25-minute working & 5-minute break is a good starting point for newbies. How many cycles do you need in a day? It depends on your workload. It's time hustle. Create a new session and follow working/break cycles while working. Pomosh will help you focus.

### Main Features:

- Timer: Helps you to follow Pomodoro Technique practices. It shows remaining working/break time with remaining cycles in your session. You can start/pause with clicking. The first click on the timer creates a session. You can think session = your typical working day. The timer automatically continues between work/break cycles. You cannot skip a period. But, yes, you can pause the timer.

- Background-mode: You can send Pomosh the app to background and Pomosh gonna notify you when working or break time ends. You need to tap to start timer to proceed next period (break or work). 

- Settings: Pomosh is flexible. You can easily change the working & break duration. Also, you can set total cycles in a session, which depends on your workload and rhythm. Long breaks can trigger spesific round with custom duration. If you sen 1hr for a single round, you need looooooong break. I guess.

- Sound effects: A chime effect indicates time is up. You can turn off it off course.

- Written with Swift & SwiftUI
